## **Introduction to Folium**

Folium is a strong Python library for creating many types of Leaflet maps. Because the Folium findings are interactive, this library is ideal for dashboard development.

From the official Folium documentation page:

*   Folium builds on the data wrangling strengths of the Python ecosystem and the mapping strengths of the Leaflet.js library. Manipulate your data in Python, then visualize it in on a Leaflet map via Folium.

*   Folium makes it easy to visualize data that's been manipulated in Python on an interactive Leaflet map. It enables both the binding of data to a map for choropleth visualizations as well as passing Vincent/Vega visualizations as markers on the map.

*   The library has a number of built-in tilesets from OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, and Stamen, and supports custom tilesets with Mapbox or Cloudmade API keys. Folium supports both GeoJSON and TopoJSON overlays, as well as the binding of data to those overlays to create choropleth maps with color-brewer color schemes.

Folium makes it simple to create a globe map. You just construct and display a Folium Map object. Folium maps are appealing because they are interactive, allowing you to zoom into any location of interest regardless of the initial zoom level.

Let's get started. Folium
Folium is not included by default. So, before we can import it, we must first install it.
